# Accident
Using Deep Learning to see if an accident is a car-related accident or a bike-related accident.


Predicting if an accident is a car_accident or a bike_accident using the super powerful fastai library. 
The dataset consists of about 500 images of car and bike crashes. 
We use a resnet34 to train our model on the image dataset and see if we can predict correctly, the type of crash.
